This folder was made to centralize where endpoints are imported and used from
so that URLs don't have to be changed across the project. 

In order to update the URL, simply add the base endpoint path to an env variable called "BASE_API_ENDPOINT".

In order to add a route, simply add to the service file it belongs to.
